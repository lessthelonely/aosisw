| Q01  | Despite its benefits, the application of gamification in SEET also presents several challenges. Designing effective gamified systems requires a deep understanding of both game design and educational pedagogy. There is a need to balance game elements with educational content to ensure that learning objectives are met without compromising the fun and engagement aspects [22].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | It's very hard to design a proper gamification environment without sacrificing learning or the "fun" part.                                       | Difficulty in Gamification                                                                                            |

| Q09  | Teaching the SE module presents challenges to educators as they struggle to choose the most appropriate and effective methods for delivering content to the students [5] with some studies [6�8] highlighting the lack of interest in the subject. The study in [9] highlights the importance of technology in fostering motivation and engagement in students learning. Kadar et al. in [7] identify students� attitudes as one of the contributing factors to learning difficulties in subjects like SE. Engaging with a particular subject or activity out of interest can lead to changes in attitude over time. However, �if students are not interested or motivated, it is difficult to keep them engaged in classrooms� [10]. Perhaps, capturing students� interest becomes a vital starting point in the teaching and learning of subjects such as SE, which are perceived by students as dry and boring [10]. | There are quite a few issues when teaching Software Engineering.                                                                                 | Important Factors of Software Engineering and its Teaching                                                            |
| Q10  | SE is a competent subject requiring active involvement by students [17], which should come from increased interest; otherwise, students will miss the essence of what needs to be learned. There is a need to craft teaching and learning styles to trigger the interest that most students lack when taking Software Engineering courses. Claypool and Claypool [8] lament the lack of fun factors as one of the causes leading to low student interest. Practitioners voice the difficulties associated with teaching Software Engineering courses since frequently students lack the desire [18] to practice the material before the lecture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Motivation is very important for learning software engineering.                                                                                  | Important Factors of Software Engineering and its Teaching                                                            |
| Q11  | One of the major challenges for improving SE practice is to improve interest in the subject, as the majority approach the subject with the background thinking that the subject is difficult.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Software engineering is seen as complicated.                                                                                                     | Important Factors of Software Engineering and its Teaching                                                            |
| Q12  | Gamification could be used to transform tasks that could be considered boring into interesting ones [50]. This is because gamification elicits some emotions, such as positive emotional experiences and powerful emotions [51]. It should also be noted that, if applied without caution, competition can demoralise some students, resulting in a loss of interest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | One needs to consciously and carefully use gamification to avoid it having negative effects on the learning process.                             | Accessibility in Gamification                                                                                         |
| Q13  | Furthermore, gamification improves the rate of engagement among students in areas such as forums and projects, leading to improved attendance rates, participation rates, pass rates, and the undertaking of difficult assignments [48, 49]. Gamification could provide students who are introverts with a great opportunity to express themselves in a classroom environment and participate in games [51]. In a way, these introverted students who may not participate in a traditional class could participate for free because of gamification. Gamification promotes self-learning as it enables learning to take place even outside the classroom [51]. This enables students to learn on their own time, learn in the process of playing, and learn at their own pace [52].                                                                                                                                     | Gamification tends to positively affect engagement and motivation.

| Q14  | Gamification is believed to be useful when dealing with lower-risk assignments such as quizzes and practical activities but does not significantly influence performance on final exams [47]. However, learners can experience emotions such as frustration, wonder, mystery, and amusement, each providing a personal connection to the game or to others playing the game [55]. Demotivating effects negatively impact student performance due to frustrations with not completing stages or levels; not understanding the rules; and not attaining rewards [56].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Motivation in crucial in gamification.                                                                                                           | Application of Gamification                                                                                           |

| Q21  | We found out that as the cognitive load of the task increases, the number of achievers decreases. This was highlighted by paper ID 14, in which only one team out of four completed the task. While this might pose unwanted challenges to the other teams, it can be a positive for the future as it highlights the levels of competence necessary for the lecturer to plan future lectures. However, we believe that using game elements such as points in games like Kahoot might not be reflective of students� potential since the ones who get high scores are the ones who quickly respond to the question. Additionally, response time can be affected by the device itself and connectivity. As such, further research is needed to develop robust assessment strategies that align with the gamified teaching approach rather than rely on game elements.                                                     | Keeping the standards going up and up may just "survival of the fittest" the students based on motivation.

| Q24  | Even though the growth of gamification in the software development industry has been notable, the adoption of gamification in software development is slower than in other domains [45].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Gamification is not as fast in its design for SE.                                                                                                | Difficulty in Gamification                                                                                            |

| Q26  | A conclusion we can reach from the result of this first classification is that existing primary studies have left out some important process areas, such as the case of software maintenance, risk management, architectural design, or software validation, for example, all of which involve different types of players that must collaborate really well if they are to complete these tasks successfully.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | There is a gap in using gamification in some areas of SD.                                                                                        | Application of Gamification / Pitfalls of Gamification                                                                |
| Q27  | There are many aspects to consider and support in the gamification of a software application or a workplace environment, one of them being to get a deep knowledge of the player profiles and their characteristics, going on to design an environment that appropriately matches those player profiles. The same game will not produce the same effect on different players, so tailoring the game to fulfill different types of player satisfaction is a crucial aspect to bear in mind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Gamification design is complex.

| Q28  | Many primary studies do not provide any evidence at all on the effect of gamification on players� motivation and performance, since the goal of these primary studies is to present a proposal for gamification, or how it has been incorporated into a CASE tool, but without carrying out an evaluation of the results in a real setting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Most gamification works do not "prove" its effectiveness, merely try to see if a proposal is well-accepted, more or less.                        | Pitfalls of Gamification                                                                                              |
| Q29  | In addition, the number of papers providing sound evidence of the impact of gamification in SE is small; the empirical evidence about the potential usefulness of gamification in SE is therefore scarce and there is vast empirical work to do to make this body of knowledge more mature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | There is very few papers that evidence the impact of gamification in SE.                                                                         | Pitfalls of Gamification                                                                                              |
| Q30  | Another aspect that deserves further research effort is the type of game design and game elements used in the proposals found in the primary studies. According to the results of our classification, more than 38% of the studies consider only the simplest gamification element, namely rewarding user�s behaviors with points, which could be called ��pointification��, instead of gamification. In our opinion, this can be a dangerous trend. The lack of user profile analysis, appropriate design methods, and gamification schemas which are too simple, can lead to applications achieving results below their expectations, risking the fulfillment of the Gartner prediction [28].                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Gamification needs more research on which elements are most effective; most often, the simplest elements are what are used.                      | Application of Gamification / Pitfalls of Gamification                                                                |
| Q31  | Another related research gap which we found during the study is the lack of a systematic methodology to incorporate gamification in SE and thus improve user engagement and performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Gamification is not usually studied with systematic methodology.                                                                                 | Pitfalls of Gamification                                                                                              |
| Q32  | In those primary studies presenting a real implementation of their proposal, gamification is often incorporated into an independent tool, usually developed ad-hoc for this purpose. In our opinion, the lack of guidelines and solutions for integrating gamification with the organization�s tool ecosystem is a weakness of the existing research in the field.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Gamification sometimes is not correctly integrated or properly studied and analysed.                                                             | Pitfalls of Gamification / Application of Gamification / Difficulty in Gamification                                   |
| Q33  | For instance, an important challenge in Software Engineering education arises from the dual nature of the Software Engineering discipline: it has roots in computer science and has emerged as an engineering discipline, and it affects both theory and practice [1]. This characteristic has a direct impact on the amount of material instructors must cover in Software Engineering classrooms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | SE education has a dual nature with theory and practice, and it very much affects the materials to cover                                         | Important Factors of Software Engineering and its Teaching                                                            |
| Q34  | One possible cause is that less experienced professors may not have time, space or confidence to use these approaches. In their responses, the reasons they alleged for not using games in classroom were most related to the lack of better understanding or the approach, not finding the adequate games that fit in their classrooms, and the investment (time) required to adapt their classes. Other possible cause is that it is time and effort demanding to find, understand and adapt educational software engineering games for the use in classroom.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Gamification may require quite a bit of effort that not all teachers can afford to make.                                                         | Application of Gamification / Difficulty in Gamification / Important Factors of Software Engineering and its Teaching |
